# Stroke-Prediction-using-classification-models
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths.
This code is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status.
